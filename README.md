# Waring - NOT READY YET

There is a bit of a chicken and egg here. I need to publish this package, but the site is not 100% ready. If you see this message, it is not ready to be used yet. Thanks!

# How I VSCode README

Easily share your current theme, font, and extensions with the community!

## Features

This extensions allows you to share some of your VSCode settings with the community.

Currently the following data is shared:

1. The name of current theme (`workbench.colorTheme`).
2. The name of your current icon theme (`workbench.iconTheme`).
3. A list of your fonts (`editor.fontFamily`).
4. A list of your current active extensions.

## Requirements

To use this extension, sign in with your GitHub account on https://howivscode.com. Once you sign in, you will be given a unique identifier key.

You will need to enter this key into the configuration setting `howIVSCode.userIdentificationKey` or via the command: "Setup HowIVSCode"

## Extension Settings

There are currently no other settings. But I am open to suggestion on additional data you would like to see shared or possibly omitted.

**Enjoy!**
